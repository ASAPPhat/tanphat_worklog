# Implementation Tasks: Weekly Hugo Worklog Website Updates

## Task Execution Protocol

- Tasks are organized by week and can be executed flexibly (not strictly sequential)
- Each task represents a complete week of updates across all website sections
- Tasks can be revisited and updated as new information becomes available
- Each task must be marked as `[-]` when started and `[x]` when completed
- All changes must preserve Hugo site functionality and bilingual support

### CRITICAL: User Information Gathering Requirement

**BEFORE starting ANY weekly update task, the AI MUST:**

1. Ask the user for specific information about that week's activities
2. Collect details about:
   - Week date range (start and end dates)
   - Daily activities for each day
   - Learning outcomes and achievements
   - Challenges faced
   - AWS services used
   - Blog translations completed (if any)
   - Workshops attended (if any)
   - Images/screenshots available
3. Confirm the information with the user before proceeding
4. NEVER fabricate or assume worklog content without explicit user input
